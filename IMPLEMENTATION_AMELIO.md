# Implementation Summary: Issue "amelio"

## Overview

Successfully implemented all three features requested in the issue:

1. ✅ **Export/Import de configuration JSON**
2. ✅ **Recadrage d'image lors de l'upload**
3. ✅ **Animation** (déjà implémentée)

## Feature 1: Export/Import Configuration JSON

### What was added:
- **Export Button** in ScenePanel: Downloads current project configuration as JSON
- **Import Button** in ScenePanel: Loads project configuration from JSON file
- JSON format includes: version, export date, and all scene data (layers, cameras, timeline, audio)

### Files modified:
- `src/App.jsx`: Added `handleExportConfig()` and `handleImportConfig()` functions
- `src/components/ScenePanel.jsx`: Added Export/Import buttons with icons

### How to use:
1. Click **"Export"** button → JSON file downloads automatically
2. Click **"Import"** button → Select a JSON file → Configuration loads

### Benefits:
- Save and restore projects
- Share projects with team members
- Version control for your animations
- Backup your work

---

## Feature 2: Image Cropping on Upload

### What was added:
- **ImageCropModal** component: Interactive image cropping interface using `react-image-crop` library
- Integrated into all image upload workflows:
  - LayerEditor (adding image layers to scenes)
  - HandWritingAnimation (Image mode)
  - HandWritingAnimation (JSON mode for source images)

### Files created:
- `src/components/ImageCropModal.jsx`: New modal component with crop controls

### Files modified:
- `package.json`: Added `react-image-crop@11.0.10` dependency
- `src/components/LayerEditor.jsx`: Integrated crop modal into image upload
- `src/components/HandWritingAnimation.jsx`: Integrated crop modal for both modes

### How to use:

#### In Scene Editor:
1. Click "Ajouter une image" (Upload icon)
2. Select an image file
3. **Crop modal opens automatically**
4. Adjust the selection area:
   - Drag corners to resize
   - Drag edges to adjust width/height
   - Drag inside to move selection
5. Choose:
   - **"Appliquer le recadrage"** → Uses only selected area
   - **"Utiliser l'image entière"** → Uses full image
   - **"Annuler"** → Cancels upload

#### In HandWriting Animation:
Same workflow for:
- "Upload Image" (Image mode)
- "Upload Source Image" (JSON mode)

### Use Case: Comic Strip (as shown in issue image)

The issue showed an image with 3 comic panels. Now you can:

1. **Upload full image** → Crop modal opens
2. **Select only Panel 1** → Apply → Creates Layer 1
3. **Upload again** → Select only Panel 2 → Apply → Creates Layer 2
4. **Upload again** → Select only Panel 3 → Apply → Creates Layer 3
5. **Animate each layer** independently with different timing/effects

This solves the exact problem stated in the issue:
> "il a des fois ou j'ai une image comme ca et je veux recuperer juste une partie"

### Benefits:
- Extract specific parts from complex images
- Remove unwanted borders/margins
- Focus on important details
- Create multi-panel animations from single images
- Reduce file sizes by cropping unnecessary areas

---

## Feature 3: Animation (Pre-existing)

The HandWritingAnimation component was already implemented with:
- Image mode: Generate animation from uploaded images
- JSON mode: Replay animations from Python-generated JSON files
- Full documentation in `docs/JSON_ANIMATION_MODE.md`

---

## Documentation Created

### New Documentation Files:
1. **`docs/JSON_EXPORT_IMPORT.md`**
   - Export/Import workflow
   - JSON format structure
   - Use cases and examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **`docs/IMAGE_CROPPING.md`**
   - How to use crop tool
   - Interface elements
   - Use cases (comic strips, focus, optimization)
   - Technical details
   - Keyboard shortcuts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added:
```json
{
  "react-image-crop": "^11.0.10"
}
```

### Architecture:

#### Export/Import:
```
User Action → ScenePanel Button → App.jsx Handler
                                      ↓
Export: JSON.stringify() → Blob → Download
Import: FileReader → JSON.parse() → setState
```

#### Image Cropping:
```
Upload Image → Read as DataURL → ImageCropModal
                                       ↓
                            User adjusts crop area
                                       ↓
                      Apply → Canvas → Blob → DataURL
                                       ↓
                              Original upload handler
```

### State Management:

**LayerEditor** added:
- `showCropModal`: Boolean to show/hide crop modal
- `pendingImageData`: Stores image URL and filename before crop

**HandWritingAnimation** added:
- `showCropModal`: Boolean to show/hide crop modal
- `pendingImageUrl`: Stores image URL before crop
- `cropTargetMode`: Tracks which mode ("image" or "json") triggered crop

---

## Testing Summary

All features tested and verified:

### Export/Import:
- ✅ Export creates valid JSON with all scene data
- ✅ Import loads configuration correctly
- ✅ Error handling for invalid JSON files
- ✅ Version and date metadata included

### Image Cropping:
- ✅ Modal opens on image upload
- ✅ Crop selection works (resize, move)
- ✅ "Apply crop" processes and uploads cropped image
- ✅ "Use entire image" bypasses crop
- ✅ "Cancel" properly cancels upload
- ✅ Works in LayerEditor
- ✅ Works in HandWritingAnimation (both modes)

### Build & Lint:
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Existing lint issues unchanged (not introduced by this PR)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Export:**
   - Click "Export" in Scènes panel
   - Check downloaded JSON file

3. **Test Import:**
   - Modify or create a JSON file
   - Click "Import" in Scènes panel
   - Select the JSON file
   - Verify scenes load correctly

4. **Test Image Cropping:**
   - Click "Ajouter une image" in Properties panel
   - Select an image
   - Adjust crop area
   - Click "Appliquer le recadrage"
   - Verify cropped image appears as layer

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible improvements for future PRs:
- Add crop aspect ratio lock option (1:1, 16:9, etc.)
- Add undo/redo for crop adjustments
- Add preset crop sizes
- Add rotation to crop tool
- Export individual scenes (not just all)
- Import/merge scenes (append instead of replace)

---

## Conclusion

All requirements from the "amelio" issue have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **JSON Export/Import** - Full project save/load capability
2. ✅ **Image Cropping** - Extract portions of images on upload
3. ✅ **Animation** - Already functional (HandWritingAnimation)

The implementation is clean, well-documented, and follows existing code patterns. The UI is intuitive with French labels matching the rest of the application.
