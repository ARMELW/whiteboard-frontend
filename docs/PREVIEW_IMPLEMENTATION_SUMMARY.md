# Preview Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation enables instant preview functionality accessible from the Play button in the AnimationHeader, allowing users to preview their animation at any time without needing to go through the full video generation process.

## Problem Statement
Previously, users could only preview their animation after going through the full video generation process in the export panel. This was time-consuming and required backend processing. The requirement was to make preview accessible instantly using the Play button in the AnimationHeader.

## Solution

### Architecture
The solution uses browser-native APIs to generate previews client-side:
1. **Scene Rendering**: Uses existing `exportSceneImage()` function to render each scene
2. **Video Creation**: Uses MediaRecorder API to capture frames and create video
3. **Preview Display**: Uses existing VideoPreviewPlayer component to display the preview

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Quick Preview Utility (`src/utils/quickPreview.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Generate instant video previews using MediaRecorder API
- **Key Features**:
  - Renders each scene as an image using existing export infrastructure
  - Captures frames at configurable FPS (default: 30)
  - Creates video blob using MediaRecorder
  - Supports configurable quality settings (width, height, fps, scene duration)
  - Provides fallback slideshow mode for compatibility

#### 2. Quick Preview Hook (`src/hooks/useQuickPreview.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manage preview generation state and integration with app
- **Key Features**:
  - Integrates with Zustand scene store
  - Manages loading and error states
  - Provides toast notifications for user feedback
  - Handles errors gracefully with extracted constants

#### 3. Animation Header Updates (`src/components/organisms/AnimationHeader.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Add preview functionality to Play button
- **Key Changes**:
  - Play button now triggers instant preview generation
  - Shows loading spinner during generation
  - Disabled state prevents multiple concurrent generations

## User Experience

### Before
1. User creates scenes
2. User clicks "Exporter" button
3. User switches to export tab
4. User configures export settings
5. User clicks "Générer la Vidéo"
6. User waits for backend processing (minutes)
7. User clicks "Prévisualiser" after generation completes

### After
1. User creates scenes
2. User clicks Play button in header
3. Preview generates instantly (seconds)
4. Preview opens automatically

## Technical Details

### Performance
- **Client-side processing**: No backend calls required
- **Frame rate**: 30 FPS (configurable)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (configurable)
- **Default duration**: 3 seconds per scene (uses scene duration if set)

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses MediaRecorder API (supported in all modern browsers)
- Fallback to WebM if VP9 codec not available
- Graceful error handling for unsupported browsers

### Code Quality
- No linting errors in new code
- No security vulnerabilities detected (CodeQL scan)
- Follows existing code patterns and architecture
- Extracted constants for maintainability
- Optimized performance (frame duration calculation)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Basic functionality**
   - Create a project with multiple scenes
   - Click Play button in header
   - Verify preview generates and plays

2. **Loading states**
   - Verify spinner appears during generation
   - Verify button is disabled during generation
   - Verify toast notifications appear

3. **Error handling**
   - Test with no scenes (should show error)
   - Test closing and reopening preview
   - Test with different scene configurations

4. **Edge cases**
   - Test with single scene
   - Test with many scenes (10+)
   - Test with complex layers (images, text, shapes)
   - Test with different scene durations

### Integration Testing
- Verify preview doesn't interfere with video export
- Verify preview can be opened multiple times
- Verify preview state is properly cleaned up

## Files Changed

### New Files
1. `src/utils/quickPreview.ts` - Preview generation utility
2. `src/hooks/useQuickPreview.ts` - Preview management hook

### Modified Files
1. `src/components/organisms/AnimationHeader.tsx` - Added preview functionality to Play button

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Progress indicator**: Show progress bar during generation
2. **Quality settings**: Allow users to configure preview quality
3. **Scene selection**: Preview specific scenes instead of all
4. **Audio support**: Include scene audio in preview
5. **Caching**: Cache generated previews for repeated views
6. **Animation preview**: Show actual layer animations instead of static frames

### Known Limitations
1. **Static scenes**: Current implementation shows static frames, not layer animations
2. **Audio**: Scene audio is not included in quick preview
3. **Memory**: Large projects may consume significant memory during generation
4. **Browser limits**: MediaRecorder has size/duration limits in some browsers

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully provides instant preview functionality through the Play button in AnimationHeader. Users can now preview their animations immediately without going through the export process or waiting for backend video generation. The solution uses client-side APIs for fast, efficient preview generation while maintaining code quality and security standards.
