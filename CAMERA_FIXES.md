# Camera Display Issues - Fix Documentation

## Issues Resolved

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve three camera-related issues in the whiteboard animation editor.

### Original Issues (French)

1. **"les cameras sont la plus bas des elements en terme de superposition, tous les elements sont en dessus du camera"**
   - Translation: "The cameras are the lowest elements in terms of stacking, all elements are above the camera"

2. **"au Zoom scène l'affichage autocentree de camera ne fonctionne plus, meme la taille du stage ne prend plus la totalité de l'espace"**
   - Translation: "When zooming the scene, the camera auto-centering display no longer works, even the stage size no longer takes up the entire space"

3. **"quand on ajoute un element il faut que ca soit directement dans le camera actuel la position, quand j'ajoute une couche"**
   - Translation: "When adding an element, it should be directly positioned in the current camera, when I add a layer"

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Camera Z-Index Fix

**Problem**: Camera viewports (pink/blue dashed borders) were appearing below Konva layer elements, making them hard to see and select.

**Root Cause**: The camera viewport container had a default z-index that was being overridden by Konva canvas rendering order.

**Solution**:
```jsx
// In SceneCanvas.jsx, line 307
<div className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none" style={{ zIndex: 9999 }}>
```

Added an explicit `z-index: 9999` to the camera viewport overlay container to ensure it always appears above all other elements.

**Result**: ✅ Camera viewports now display correctly above all layers and can be easily seen and interacted with.

### 2. Auto-Center and Infinite Canvas Fix

**Problem**: 
- When zooming the scene, the canvas didn't have scrollable space around it
- Auto-center scroll to selected camera didn't work properly
- The stage didn't maintain proper spacing

**Root Cause**: The scrollable container lacked the padding wrapper that creates the "infinite canvas" effect, as documented in previous PRs.

**Solution**:

#### Added Padding Wrapper (lines 257-258)
```jsx
{/* Padding wrapper for infinite canvas effect */}
<div style={{ padding: '500px' }}>
  {/* Scene Canvas - The actual stage */}
  <div ref={canvasRef} className="bg-white shadow-2xl" ...>
```

#### Updated Auto-Scroll Calculation (lines 203-204)
```jsx
// Calculate camera position in pixels (accounting for 500px padding)
const padding = 500;
const cameraX = (selectedCamera.position.x * sceneWidth * sceneZoom) + padding;
const cameraY = (selectedCamera.position.y * sceneHeight * sceneZoom) + padding;
```

The 500px padding creates space around the stage so users can:
- Scroll in all directions
- See the stage boundaries clearly (white stage against gray dotted background)
- Navigate to cameras positioned anywhere on the canvas

**Result**: 
- ✅ Stage now has 500px of scrollable space on all sides
- ✅ Auto-center smoothly scrolls to selected camera, accounting for padding
- ✅ Works correctly at all zoom levels (tested at 110%)

### 3. Position New Layers at Selected Camera

**Problem**: When adding a new layer, it was always positioned at a fixed coordinate (100, 100), regardless of which camera was selected.

**Root Cause**: The `LayerEditor` component didn't have access to the currently selected camera information from `SceneCanvas`.

**Solution**:

#### SceneCanvas.jsx Changes

1. Added `onSelectCamera` prop to component signature:
```jsx
const SceneCanvas = ({ 
  scene,
  onUpdateScene,
  onUpdateLayer,
  selectedLayerId,
  onSelectLayer,
  onSelectCamera,  // NEW
}) => {
```

2. Added effect to notify parent of camera selection:
```jsx
// Notify parent when camera selection changes
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (onSelectCamera) {
    const selectedCamera = sceneCameras.find(cam => cam.id === selectedCameraId);
    onSelectCamera(selectedCamera);
  }
}, [selectedCameraId, sceneCameras, onSelectCamera]);
```

#### LayerEditor.jsx Changes

1. Added state to track selected camera:
```jsx
const [selectedCamera, setSelectedCamera] = useState(null);
const sceneWidth = 1920 * 5;
const sceneHeight = 1080 * 5;
```

2. Pass callback to SceneCanvas:
```jsx
<SceneCanvas
  scene={editedScene}
  onUpdateScene={(updates) => setEditedScene({ ...editedScene, ...updates })}
  onUpdateLayer={handleUpdateLayer}
  selectedLayerId={selectedLayerId}
  onSelectLayer={setSelectedLayerId}
  onSelectCamera={setSelectedCamera}  // NEW
/>
```

3. Updated `handleImageUpload` to position at camera center:
```jsx
// Calculate initial position based on selected camera
let initialX = 100;
let initialY = 100;

if (selectedCamera && selectedCamera.position) {
  // Position the new layer at the center of the selected camera viewport
  initialX = selectedCamera.position.x * sceneWidth;
  initialY = selectedCamera.position.y * sceneHeight;
}

const newLayer = {
  id: `layer-${Date.now()}`,
  image_path: event.target.result,
  name: file.name,
  position: { x: initialX, y: initialY },  // Uses calculated position
  z_index: editedScene.layers.length + 1,
  // ... other properties
};
```

**Mathematical Verification**:
- Scene dimensions: 9600 x 5400 pixels (1920*5 x 1080*5)
- Camera 1 position: (0.4, 0.3) normalized coordinates
- Expected pixel position: X = 0.4 * 9600 = 3840, Y = 0.3 * 5400 = 1620
- Actual layer position: ✅ X = 3840, Y = 1620

**Result**: ✅ New layers are now positioned at the center of the currently selected camera viewport.

## Visual Evidence

### Before Fix
- Camera viewports were hard to see below layers
- No scrollable space when zoomed
- Layers appeared at fixed position regardless of camera

### After Fix

#### 1. Initial State with Default Camera
![Camera Editor Initial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54842af3-40e7-42aa-8056-b4a054a60817)
- Default camera visible with blue border (locked)
- Canvas at 100% zoom

## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Creating Cameras**: Click "Nouvelle Caméra" to add a camera viewport
2. **Selecting Cameras**: Use the dropdown or click directly on a camera viewport
3. **Adding Layers**: Click "Ajouter une couche" - the layer will appear at the selected camera's center
4. **Zooming**: Use the zoom controls - the view will stay centered on the selected camera
5. **Navigating**: Scroll the canvas to explore the infinite workspace

### For Developers

When working with cameras:
- Camera positions are normalized (0-1 range)
- Stage size is 9600x5400 pixels (1920*5 x 1080*5)
- Padding is 500px on all sides
- Auto-scroll effect triggers when `selectedCameraId` or `sceneZoom` changes
- Camera overlay has z-index 9999 to stay on top
