## Features Delivered

### Scene-Level Camera Sequences ✅
- [x] Multiple cameras per scene
- [x] Individual zoom, position, duration controls
- [x] Transition duration between cameras
- [x] 6 easing functions for smooth movement
- [x] Add, remove, reorder cameras
- [x] Expandable camera configuration UI

### Layer-Level Camera ✅
- [x] Per-layer camera zoom and position
- [x] Independent camera for each layer
- [x] Normalized position system (0-1)

### Layer-Level Animations ✅
- [x] Post-drawing zoom animations
- [x] Zoom In and Zoom Out types
- [x] Configurable duration and zoom range
- [x] Focus position control

### Position System ✅
- [x] Normalized coordinates (0.0 - 1.0)
- [x] X axis: 0=left, 0.5=center, 1=right
- [x] Y axis: 0=top, 0.5=center, 1=bottom
- [x] Position validation and normalization

### Easing Functions ✅
- [x] linear - constant speed
- [x] ease_in - slow start, fast end
- [x] ease_out - fast start, slow end (recommended)
- [x] ease_in_out - slow start and end
- [x] ease_in_cubic - very slow start
- [x] ease_out_cubic - very slow end

## Data Structures

### Camera Object
```javascript
{
  zoom: 1.0,                  // float, 0.1-10
  position: {
    x: 0.5,                   // float, 0.0-1.0
    y: 0.5                    // float, 0.0-1.0
  },
  duration: 2.0,              // float, seconds
  transition_duration: 1.0,   // float, seconds
  easing: "ease_out"          // string, easing function
}
```

### Animation Object
```javascript
{
  type: "zoom_in",            // "zoom_in" | "zoom_out"
  duration: 2.0,              // float, seconds
  start_zoom: 1.0,            // float, 0.1-10
  end_zoom: 2.0,              // float, 0.1-10
  focus_position: {
    x: 0.5,                   // float, 0.0-1.0
    y: 0.5                    // float, 0.0-1.0
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

### Build Status
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ No errors or critical warnings
- ✅ Bundle size: ~581 KB (acceptable)

### Unit Tests
- ✅ All easing functions working correctly
- ✅ Interpolation functions accurate
- ✅ Camera creation with proper defaults
- ✅ Camera sequence calculations correct
- ✅ Validation catching invalid inputs
- ✅ Position normalization working

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Scene camera controls visible and functional
- ✅ Layer camera controls visible and functional
- ✅ Animation controls visible and functional
- ✅ UI properly integrated in LayerEditor
- ✅ Add/remove/reorder cameras working
- ✅ All sliders and inputs functional
- ✅ Save/load functionality working

## Screenshots Captured
1. Scene camera sequence controls (empty state)
2. Scene camera expanded with full controls
3. Layer editor with camera and animation sections
4. Layer animation controls expanded

## Code Quality
- **Total Lines Added**: ~1,157 lines
- **Comments**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments on all functions
- **Consistency**: Follows existing code style
- **Modularity**: Well-separated concerns
- **Reusability**: Components and utilities designed for reuse

## Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrated into existing LayerEditor
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible (scenes without cameras work fine)
- Ready for future enhancements

## Future Enhancements
Potential additions for future iterations:
- Pan animations (horizontal/vertical movement)
- Rotation support
- Camera presets for common patterns
- Timeline preview of camera path
- Keyframe-based camera animation
- Camera shake effects
- Multiple simultaneous cameras (picture-in-picture)

## Conclusion
The camera feature has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ All required functionality from the issue
- ✅ Comprehensive UI controls
- ✅ Robust utilities and helpers
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Passing tests
- ✅ Production-ready code

The implementation supports the full specification from the issue, including:
- Camera sequences at slide level
