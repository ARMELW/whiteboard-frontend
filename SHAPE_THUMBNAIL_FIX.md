# Shape Layer Thumbnail Fix

## Issue
When adding shapes to a scene, they were not being displayed in the thumbnail preview. The issue title stated: "l'ajout de forme ne créer pas de layer correspondant et aussi ca ne s'affiche pas sur le thumbnail" (Adding shapes doesn't create a corresponding layer and also doesn't display on the thumbnail).

**Note:** Upon investigation, shapes WERE actually being added to layers correctly and displayed in both the main canvas and layer lists. The actual issue was specifically that shapes were not being rendered in the thumbnail preview canvas - this gave the appearance that the layer wasn't created when viewing the thumbnail maker.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Working
1. ✅ Shapes were being properly added to the scene layers
2. ✅ Shapes were displayed in the main canvas (SceneCanvas.tsx with LayerShape component)
3. ✅ Shapes were shown in the main layer list (LayersList.tsx)
4. ✅ Shapes were shown in the thumbnail's layer list (ThumbnailLayersList.tsx)

### What Was Missing
❌ Shapes were NOT being rendered in the thumbnail preview canvas itself

The `ThumbnailMaker` component only handled `image` and `text` layer types in its rendering logic (lines 267-290). The `ThumbnailLayer` type definition (lines 15-40) also didn't include a shape type option.

## Solution

### 1. Created ThumbnailShapeLayer Component
**File:** `src/components/molecules/thumbnail/ThumbnailShapeLayer.tsx`

A new component that renders shape layers in the thumbnail preview canvas, supporting all shape types:
- Basic shapes (rectangle, circle, triangle, etc.)
- Lines and arrows
- Advanced shapes (star, cloud, bubbles, etc.)
- Doodle shapes
- Character shapes (numbers and letters)
- Decorative shapes

The component reuses the same shape rendering components used in the main canvas (from `atoms/shapes` and `molecules/shapes`), ensuring visual consistency.

### 2. Updated ThumbnailMaker Type Definitions
**File:** `src/components/organisms/ThumbnailMaker.tsx`

Extended the `ThumbnailLayer` union type to include shape layers:
```typescript
| {
    id: string;
    type: 'shape';
    x: number;
    y: number;
    scaleX: number;
    scaleY: number;
    rotation: number;
    shape_config: any;
  }
```

### 3. Added Shape Rendering Logic
**File:** `src/components/organisms/ThumbnailMaker.tsx`

Added shape handling in the thumbnail canvas rendering:
```typescript
} else if (layer.type === 'shape') {
  return (
    <ThumbnailShapeLayer
      key={layer.id}
      layer={layer}
      isSelected={layer.id === selectedLayerId}
      onSelect={() => setSelectedLayerId(layer.id)}
      onChange={handleLayerChange}
    />
  );
}
```

### 4. Updated Exports
**File:** `src/components/molecules/thumbnail/index.ts`

Added exports for the new component:
```typescript
export { ThumbnailShapeLayer } from './ThumbnailShapeLayer';
export type { ThumbnailShapeLayerProps } from './ThumbnailShapeLayer';
```

## Files Changed
- `src/components/molecules/thumbnail/ThumbnailShapeLayer.tsx` (new file, 287 lines)
- `src/components/molecules/thumbnail/index.ts` (2 lines added)
- `src/components/organisms/ThumbnailMaker.tsx` (21 lines added)

## Testing
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ No new linting issues introduced
- ✅ All shape types are supported (basic, advanced, doodle, characters)
- ✅ Shape transformations (drag, scale, rotate) work in thumbnail editor
- ✅ Visual consistency with main canvas rendering

## Impact
Users can now:
1. Add shapes to scenes and see them immediately in the thumbnail preview
2. Edit shape positions, sizes, and rotations in the thumbnail maker
3. Export thumbnails with shapes properly rendered
4. Have consistent shape rendering between main canvas and thumbnail preview

## Technical Notes
- The ThumbnailShapeLayer component follows the same pattern as ThumbnailImageLayer and ThumbnailTextLayer
- It uses React Konva for rendering with transformer support for interactive editing
- All existing shape types from the main canvas are supported without modification
- The component properly handles shape_config properties including position, scale, rotation, and shape-specific attributes
