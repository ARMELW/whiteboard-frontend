## 🔧 Technical Features

### Plan Limit Validation
```javascript
Free:    1 channel
Creator: 3 channels
Pro:     10 channels
Agency:  Unlimited
```
Automatically validated before channel creation with upgrade prompt.

### Brand Kit Customization

- 3-color palette (primary, secondary, accent)
- Live preview
- Auto-save on changes

### Project Filtering
- Search by title (real-time)
- Filter by status (draft, in_progress, completed)
- Sort by date or title
- Maintains filter state

### Error Handling
- Plan limit reached → Upgrade modal
- Channel has projects → Block deletion
- Form validation → Field-level errors
- Network errors → Toast notifications

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Desktop (lg: 1024px+)
- 3-column channel grid
- 4-column project grid
- Full navigation bar

### Tablet (md: 768px-1023px)
- 2-column channel grid
- 2-column project grid
- Compact navigation

### Mobile (sm: <768px)
- 1-column layouts
- Stacked filters
- Touch-optimized

---

## 🔌 Backend Integration Path

### API Endpoints Ready
All endpoints defined in `src/config/api.ts`:
- Channels: `/channels` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Projects: `/channels/:id/projects` (GET, POST)
- Stats: `/channels/:id/stats` (GET)
- Logo: `/channels/:id/brand-kit/logo` (POST)

### Mock Service Pattern
Each mock service can be easily replaced:
1. Update `channelMockService.ts` → `channelService.ts`
2. Replace mock methods with HTTP calls
3. Use existing `httpClient` from `src/services/api`
4. Keep same interface for hooks

### Example Migration
```typescript
// Before (Mock)
async list() {
  await this.delay(300);
  return mockChannels;
}

// After (Real API)
async list() {
  const response = await httpClient.get(API_ENDPOINTS.channels.list);
  return response.data;
}
```
