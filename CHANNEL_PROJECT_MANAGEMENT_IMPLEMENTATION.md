# 🎬 Channel and Project Management System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

This implementation adds a complete **Channel and Project Management System** to the Whiteboard Frontend application, allowing users to organize their video projects by YouTube channels with full CRUD capabilities.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Data Layer

#### Type Definitions
Created comprehensive TypeScript types for:
- **Channel**: YouTube channel with brand kit (logo, colors), project count, stats
- **Project**: Video project with metadata (title, resolution, aspect ratio, duration)
- **BrandKit**: Channel branding (logo, 3 colors, intro/outro videos)
- **ChannelStats**: Analytics (projects by status, export count, activity)

**Location**: `src/app/channels/types.ts`, `src/app/projects/types.ts`

#### State Management (Zustand)
- **Channel Store**: Manages channels list, current channel, loading/error states
- **Project Store**: Manages projects list, current project, loading/error states

**Location**: `src/app/channels/store.ts`, `src/app/projects/store.ts`

#### Custom Hooks
- `useChannels()`: Fetches and manages channel list
- `useChannelsActions()`: CRUD operations (create, update, delete, archive, uploadLogo)
- `useProjects()`: Fetches and manages projects (optionally filtered by channel)
- `useProjectsActions()`: CRUD operations (create, update, duplicate, delete, autosave)

**Location**: 
- `src/app/channels/hooks/`
- `src/app/projects/hooks/`

#### Mock Services
Full-featured mock API services simulating backend operations:
- **Channel Service**: 
  - Plan limits validation (free: 1, creator: 3, pro: 10, agency: unlimited)
  - Logo upload simulation
  - Stats generation
  - Archive/delete with validation
- **Project Service**:
  - Channel association
  - Status management (draft, in_progress, completed)
  - Soft delete (recoverable for 30 days)
  - Duplication

**Location**: 
- `src/app/channels/api/channelMockService.ts`
- `src/app/projects/api/projectMockService.ts`
