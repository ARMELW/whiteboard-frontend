# Shape Layer Refactoring - Implementation Summary

## Date: November 1, 2025

## Overview

This refactoring separates the handling of two distinct types of shapes in the whiteboard application:
1. **Built-in geometric shapes** (circles, rectangles, stars, etc.) - rendered procedurally using Konva shapes
2. **SVG shape assets** (user-uploaded SVG files) - loaded from URLs like images

## Problem Statement

Previously, the `LayerShape` component was handling both types of shapes, which created complexity and made the code harder to maintain. SVG shapes loaded from uploaded files should be treated like images since they're loaded from URLs, while built-in shapes are rendered programmatically from configuration data.

## Solution Architecture

### New Component: LayerSvg

Created `src/components/molecules/canvas/LayerSvg.tsx` to handle SVG shape assets:
- Similar implementation to `LayerImage` component
- Uses `useImage` hook to load SVG from `svg_path` property
- Supports all standard layer features:
  - Dragging and transformation
  - Multi-layer selection and movement
  - Camera position awareness
  - Scale, rotation, opacity controls
  - Boundary constraints

### Updated Components

#### 1. SceneCanvas (`src/components/organisms/SceneCanvas.tsx`)
```typescript
// Differentiate between SVG and built-in shapes
if (layer.type === 'shape') {
  if (layer.svg_path) {
    // Render with LayerSvg
    return <LayerSvg ... />;
  } else {
    // Render with LayerShape
    return <LayerShape ... />;
  }
}
```

#### 2. Export Utilities

**layerExporter.ts**:
- Updated validation to accept shapes with either `shape_config` OR `svg_path`

**cameraExporter.ts**:
- Renders SVG shapes as images using their `svg_path`
- Falls back to procedural rendering for built-in shapes

**sceneExporter.ts**:
- Similar handling - SVG shapes treated as images during export

#### 3. Thumbnail Components

**ThumbnailMaker.tsx**:
- SVG shapes use `ThumbnailImageLayer` (passing `svg_path` as `src`)
- Built-in shapes continue using `ThumbnailShapeLayer`

#### 4. Utility Functions

**multiLayerDrag.ts**:
- Updated comments to clarify SVG shapes are handled like images
- Only built-in shapes with `shape_config` get special position handling

**previewService.ts**:
- Added `svg_path` to layer type definition
- Included in preview payload sent to backend

## Layer Properties

### Built-in Shape Layer
```typescript
{
  type: 'shape',
  shape_config: {
    shape: 'circle' | 'rectangle' | ...,
    x: number,
    y: number,
    width: number,
    height: number,
    fill_color: string,
    // ... other shape-specific properties
  },
  position: { x, y },
  scale: number,
  opacity: number,
  // ... other common properties
}
```

### SVG Shape Layer
```typescript
{
  type: 'shape',
  svg_path: string, // URL to SVG file
  position: { x, y },
  width: number,
  height: number,
  scale: number,
  opacity: number,
  rotation: number,
  // ... other common properties
  // NO shape_config
}
```

## Files Modified

### New Files
1. `src/components/molecules/canvas/LayerSvg.tsx` (197 lines)

### Modified Files
1. `src/components/molecules/canvas/index.ts` - Export LayerSvg
2. `src/components/organisms/SceneCanvas.tsx` - Route to appropriate component
3. `src/utils/layerExporter.ts` - Validation update
4. `src/utils/cameraExporter.ts` - SVG export handling (2 locations)
5. `src/utils/sceneExporter.ts` - SVG export handling
6. `src/components/organisms/ThumbnailMaker.tsx` - Thumbnail rendering
7. `src/utils/multiLayerDrag.ts` - Comment update
8. `src/services/api/previewService.ts` - Type and payload update

## Benefits

### 1. Clearer Separation of Concerns
- `LayerShape` now only handles built-in geometric shapes
- `LayerSvg` handles user-uploaded SVG assets
- Each component is focused on a single responsibility

### 2. Consistent Architecture
- SVG shapes are treated like images throughout the codebase
- Reuses proven patterns from `LayerImage` component
- Easier to maintain and understand

### 3. Improved Type Safety
- Clear distinction between shape types in code
- Better TypeScript support
- Reduced risk of runtime errors

### 4. Export Consistency
- All export utilities handle both shape types correctly
- SVG shapes exported as images (as they should be)
- Built-in shapes continue to render procedurally

## Usage Example

### Creating an SVG Shape Layer

```typescript
import { createLayerFromShapeAsset } from '@/utils/svgShapeLayerUtils';

// When user selects an SVG shape from the library
const handleAddShapeToScene = (shape: ShapeAsset) => {
  const newLayer = createLayerFromShapeAsset(shape, currentScene.layers.length);
  // newLayer will have:
  // - type: 'shape'
  // - svg_path: shape.url
  // - NO shape_config
  
  addLayer({ sceneId: currentScene.id, layer: newLayer });
};
```

### Rendering Logic

```typescript
// SceneCanvas automatically routes to correct component
{sortedLayers.map((layer) => {
  if (layer.type === 'shape') {
    if (layer.svg_path) {
      // User-uploaded SVG shape
      return <LayerSvg layer={layer} ... />;
    } else {
      // Built-in geometric shape
      return <LayerShape layer={layer} ... />;
    }
  }
  // ... other layer types
})}
```

## Migration Notes

### Existing Code
No migration needed for existing code! The changes are backward compatible:
- Existing built-in shapes continue to work with `LayerShape`
- New SVG shapes automatically use `LayerSvg`
- All export and utility functions handle both types

### New Features
When implementing new features that work with layers:
- Check for `layer.svg_path` to identify SVG shapes
- SVG shapes should be treated like images (loaded from URL)
- Built-in shapes can be identified by presence of `shape_config`

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future iterations:

1. **Layer Type Enum**
   - Add `LayerType.SVG_SHAPE` to distinguish from built-in shapes
   - Would make the code even more explicit

2. **Shape Type Union**
   - Create TypeScript union types for shape layers
   - `ShapeLayer = BuiltInShapeLayer | SvgShapeLayer`

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading of SVG assets
   - Caching strategies for frequently used shapes

4. **Additional Shape Features**
   - Color customization for SVG shapes
   - Path editing capabilities
   - SVG optimization on upload

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully separates the handling of built-in and SVG shapes, making the codebase cleaner, more maintainable, and following established patterns. The changes are backward compatible, fully tested, and ready for production use.
