# Camera Scroll and Infinite Canvas Fix

## Issue Summary
The camera viewport system had several issues:
1. No "infinite stage" effect - the canvas was centered without scrollable space
2. The background was uniformly white, making it hard to distinguish the stage from the surrounding area
3. No auto-scroll functionality when selecting a camera
4. No visual progress/indication of the scrollable canvas area

## Changes Made

### 1. Infinite Canvas Background
**File**: `src/components/SceneCanvas.jsx`

- Changed the scroll container background from white to dark gray (`bg-gray-800`)
- Added a radial gradient dot pattern to create a visual grid effect:
  ```jsx
  backgroundImage: 'radial-gradient(circle, #4b5563 1px, transparent 1px)',
  backgroundSize: '20px 20px',
  ```
- This creates a clear visual distinction between the infinite canvas and the actual stage

### 2. Scrollable Container with Padding
**Before**: The canvas was centered using flexbox with `flex items-center justify-center`
**After**: Changed to `overflow-auto` with a padding container

```jsx
<div className="flex-1 bg-gray-800 relative overflow-auto">
  <div style={{ 
    minWidth: `${sceneWidth * sceneZoom + 1000}px`,
    minHeight: `${sceneHeight * sceneZoom + 1000}px`,
    padding: '500px'
  }}>
    {/* Stage content here */}
  </div>
</div>
```

This creates:
- 500px of scrollable space on all sides of the stage
- An "infinite canvas" effect where users can scroll in all directions
- Clear visual boundaries when the stage ends

### 3. Auto-Scroll to Selected Camera
Added a new `useEffect` hook that automatically scrolls the viewport to center on a selected camera:

```jsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedCameraId && scrollContainerRef.current && canvasRef.current) {
    const selectedCamera = sceneCameras.find(cam => cam.id === selectedCameraId);
    if (selectedCamera) {
      const container = scrollContainerRef.current;
      
      // Calculate camera position in pixels
      const cameraX = selectedCamera.position.x * sceneWidth * sceneZoom;
      const cameraY = selectedCamera.position.y * sceneHeight * sceneZoom;
      
      // Calculate scroll position to center the camera
      const scrollX = cameraX - (container.clientWidth / 2);
      const scrollY = cameraY - (container.clientHeight / 2);
      
      // Smooth scroll to camera position
      container.scrollTo({
        left: scrollX,
        top: scrollY,
        behavior: 'smooth'
      });
    }
  }
}, [selectedCameraId, sceneCameras, sceneWidth, sceneHeight, sceneZoom]);
```

This automatically centers the camera in the viewport when:
- A camera is selected from the toolbar
- The camera position or zoom changes
- The scene zoom changes

### 4. Enhanced Stage Visibility
The actual stage (1920x1080 white canvas) now has:
- A white background (`bg-white`)
- A large shadow (`shadow-2xl`) to make it stand out against the gray infinite canvas
- Clear positioning within the scrollable container

## Visual Impact

### Before:
- White background everywhere
- Canvas centered, no scrolling
- Cameras might be positioned outside the visible area
- No visual distinction between stage and surrounding area

### After:
- Dark gray infinite canvas with dot pattern
- White stage clearly visible with shadow
- Scrollable in all directions
- Auto-scrolls to center selected camera
- Clear visual feedback of the scrollable area

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `src/components/SceneCanvas.jsx`
   - Added auto-scroll useEffect hook
   - Changed scroll container styling
   - Added padding container for infinite scroll
   - Updated stage styling for better visibility

### Browser Compatibility:
- Uses standard CSS properties
- `scrollTo` with smooth behavior (widely supported)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### Performance:
- No additional re-renders
- Efficient scroll calculations
- Uses React's built-in optimization (useEffect dependencies)

## Testing

### Build Status:
✅ Build successful (npm run build)
✅ No lint errors (npm run lint)
✅ Dev server starts correctly

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Infinite canvas background is visible (dark gray with dots)
- [ ] Stage (white canvas) is clearly visible with shadow
- [ ] Can scroll in all directions around the stage
- [ ] Selecting a camera auto-scrolls to center it
- [ ] Camera viewport is visible and interactive
- [ ] Zoom controls work correctly with the new layout
- [ ] Multiple cameras can be selected and centered

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future iterations:
1. Add a minimap to show camera positions relative to the stage
2. Add visual indicators when scrolling near the stage boundaries
3. Add keyboard shortcuts to navigate between cameras
4. Add a "fit to view" button to zoom/scroll to see the entire stage
5. Add snap-to-grid functionality for camera positioning
