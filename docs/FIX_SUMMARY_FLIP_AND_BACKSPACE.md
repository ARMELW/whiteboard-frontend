# Fix Summary: Flip Handling and Text Editing Issues

## Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Flip Properties Not Applied in Thumbnail Generation
**Problem**: When generating thumbnails for scenes, the `flipX` and `flipY` properties of image layers were being ignored. This caused thumbnails to show the unflipped version of images even when they were flipped in the editor.

**Root Cause**: The `renderImageLayer` function in `src/utils/sceneExporter.ts` did not check for or apply flip transformations.

**Solution**: 
- Added extraction of `flipX` and `flipY` properties from layer objects
- Applied horizontal flip using `ctx.scale(-1, 1)` when `flipX` is true
- Applied vertical flip using `ctx.scale(1, -1)` when `flipY` is true
- Optimized transformation logic to only translate to center when rotation or flip is needed
- Used nullish coalescing operator (??) for better type safety with boolean properties
- Ensured consistent rotation checks using `!== 0` instead of falsy checks

### Issue 2: Backspace Deletes Layer When Editing Text
**Problem**: When users were typing in the text content textarea in the properties panel and pressed Backspace to delete characters, the entire layer would be deleted from the canvas instead of just deleting the character.

**Root Cause**: The global keyboard event handler in `SceneCanvas.tsx` was listening for Backspace key presses to delete selected layers, but it only checked the `isEditingText` flag which was only set for the modal text editor (which is currently commented out). The properties panel textarea didn't set this flag.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the keyboard event handler to check if the event target is an INPUT, TEXTAREA, or contentEditable element
- Added early return when user is typing in these elements to prevent layer deletion
- Used the `isContentEditable` boolean property for proper detection
- Preserved the layer deletion functionality when no input is focused

## Files Modified

### src/utils/sceneExporter.ts
```typescript
// Added flip property extraction
const flipX = layer.flipX ?? false;
const flipY = layer.flipY ?? false;

// Optimized transformation logic
if (rotation !== 0 || flipX || flipY) {
  ctx.translate(layerX + imgWidth / 2, layerY + imgHeight / 2);
  
  if (rotation !== 0) {
    ctx.rotate(rotation * Math.PI / 180);
  }
  
  ctx.scale(flipX ? -1 : 1, flipY ? -1 : 1);
  
  ctx.drawImage(img, -imgWidth / 2, -imgHeight / 2, imgWidth, imgHeight);
} else {
  // No transformations: simple top-left positioning
  ctx.drawImage(img, layerX, layerY, imgWidth, imgHeight);
}
```

### src/components/organisms/SceneCanvas.tsx
```typescript
const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
  if ((e.key === 'Delete' || e.key === 'Backspace') && selectedLayerIds.length > 0) {
    if (isEditingText) return;
    
    // Check if user is typing in any input/textarea
    const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
    if (target.tagName === 'INPUT' || target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA' || target.isContentEditable) {
      return;
    }
    
    e.preventDefault();
    // ... delete layers
  }
};
```

## Testing

- ✅ Build verification: No errors introduced
- ✅ Lint check: No new issues
- ✅ Code review: All feedback addressed
- ✅ Security scan (CodeQL): No vulnerabilities found
- ✅ Backward compatibility: Images without flip properties work as before

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Thumbnails**: Thumbnails now correctly reflect the visual state of images including flip transformations
2. **Better UX**: Users can now edit text without accidentally deleting layers
3. **Performance**: Optimized transformation logic only applies transformations when needed
4. **Type Safety**: Used nullish coalescing for better handling of boolean properties
5. **Code Quality**: Consistent rotation checks throughout the codebase

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Images without `flipX` or `flipY` properties default to `false` (no flip)
- Text editing in other components remains unaffected
- Layer deletion via keyboard still works when no input is focused
